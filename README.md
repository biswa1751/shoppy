# Shoppy - Simple and Most Economical Billing and Invoicing Software for Small Businesses

Shoppy helps small businesses to bill and make invoices 3x faster by leveraging the existing traditional system of retail billing, but without having to invest much in hardware. The items are scanned using the camera of ones already owned smartphone, the calculation and list generation is done in-app, and all one needs to print a physical invoice is a thermal printer that can connect to any smartphone wired or wirelessly. The best part? All data is fetched and stored in the cloud, so the data syncs on every device that is viewing the app which enables not only the shopowner but also multiple employees to edit and review the billing that's going on currently for a customer. To offer more flexibility and improved speeds the app is also compatible with dedicated barcode scanners so that one has the option to further improve the efficiency and speed if one wishes to incorporate a dedicated barcode scanner in the future.
